>>>>>>> parent of 44c103c... Main menu now displays with AngularJS implemented.  Linked the word "bio" to a very basic view.  Changed how "bio" was positioned on screen - no longer is a block and therefore I took out the vertical padding.  I spaced it vertically with <br> instead.  I might change that to something better later.  None of the other words have links or implemented views.
